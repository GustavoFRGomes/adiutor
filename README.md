# Auditor

This is the repository for an ambitious idea, a set of tools for both web, Android and iOS that can help me presenting myself to the world, and ultimately it's more about the challenge to make all these small integrations and banging my head on the wall when some of the products have convulted ways of exposing the information I want to get from them.

## Repo Organization

This will be a monorepo which should contain both mobile apps that help me fetch my own data when I am using my mobile devices, as well as both some server side technologies, and the culmination of my work, the web app what can introduce me to the world.

The mobile apps are done in KMM, therefore if you are familiar with the technology you can jump right into _mobile_.
The web app and backend are together, for the web app I tried Web Components and the backend is a beautiful Flask app, their code can be found of course under _backend_. The reasoning for the name is just that it's server side, the web app needs to be requested from the backend/server in order to appear for the users, as silly as that might sound it is my own preference at this time.
